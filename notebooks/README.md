## data processing

- TROPOMI_NO2_mean.ipynb

  Calculation of the daily mean NO2 in selected region.

## visualization

- all_visualization.ipynb

  Interactive visualization tool of TROPOMI NO2/Cloud Fraction, U.S. AIS, and ERA5 hourly wind. The video example and cases are shown in the [ppt directory](https://github.com/zxdawn/TRACER/tree/main/ppt).
  
- mail_shipping_lanes.ipynb

  This notebook shows the ship density over main "straight" shipping lanes. We choose straight lanes for better and easier ship tracking/prediction, and comparison with TROPOMI NO2 data.
  
- ship_visualization.ipynb

  Quickview of U.S. AIS ship tracks

## machine learning

- correlation.ipynb
  
  Depiction of correlation between various parameters responsible for NO2 generation using Multivariate Analysis.
  
- ML_model_1.ipynb

  Simple neural network to predict the NO2 generation on a specific day using the parameters which were having specific correlation in multivariate analysis.
  
- ML_model_2.ipynb

  Simple neural network to predict the NO2 generation on a specific day using the parameters which were having specific correlation in multivariate analysis.
